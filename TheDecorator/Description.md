###  The Decorator Pattern 

A decorator allows us to dynamically extend the behavior of a particular object at runtime, without needing to resort to unnecessary inheritance. Let me give you a demonstration.

#### [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)

In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.[1] The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.[2] The decorator pattern is structurally nearly identical to the chain of responsibility pattern, the difference being that in a chain of responsibility, exactly one of the classes handles the request, while for the decorator, all classes handle the request.
